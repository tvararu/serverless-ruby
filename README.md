# Serverless Ruby using now

## Prerequisites

Install `now` ([or use another method](https://zeit.co/download)):

```bash
curl -sfLS https://zeit.co/download.sh | sh
```

## Run locally

```bash
now dev
```

(Seems broken at the moment but the Ruby builder is only 1 week old at the time of this writing, so give it some time...)

## Deploy

```bash
